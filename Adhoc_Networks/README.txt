This folder is for the AAAI main track submission "Control and Reinforcement Learning for Non-Cumulative Objective Functions".
It includes all code files for wireless ad hoc network routing simulations.

python scripts:
  main.py --- the training script to train agents for all explored reinforcement learning methods.
  evaluate.py --- the evaluation script to evaluate the trained agents.
  system_parameters.py --- the script to specify the wireless ad hoc network settings as well as all hyperparameters used.
  agent.py --- the implementation of Q-Min, Q-Sum, and Q-MC algorithms, along with other fundamental functionalities in reinforcement learning agents.   

saved models:
  The trained neural network models for Q-Min, Q-Sum, and Q-MCUnder are located under the folder DQN/Trained_Models. 
  The evaluation results are also stored in this folder as the pickle file.
